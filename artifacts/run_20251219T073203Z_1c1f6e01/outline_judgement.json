    "Instruction following": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The user provided a tool call to search for information about Python 3.12 features, but did not generate an actual outline or answer. The absence of any content means the response fails to follow the instruction to provide an answer, including the expected structured format. There is no evaluation possible regarding topic, scope, audience, purpose, level of detail, tone, structure, or formatting, as none of these were addressed. The response is non-existent in terms of fulfilling the user's request for an outline or analysis."
    },
    "Depth": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The evaluation is based solely on the provided instruction to search for information about Python 3.12 features. There is no actual outline provided in the answer. The task requires a structured report assessing Depth, but the 'Answer' section is empty, containing only a tool call instruction. This fails entirely to meet the criterion of Depth, as no comprehensiveness, analytical depth, subpoints, arguments, mechanisms, assumptions, methods, metrics, success criteria, sequencing, logic, dependencies, open questions, or integration points are present. It is a non-answer that attempts to bypass the requirement by instructing an action instead of performing it. Therefore, the score is 0."
    },
    "Balance": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The prompt explicitly requires the evaluator to assess the quality of an answer to the question 'What are the key features of Python 3.12?' based on the criterion of 'Balance' in the outline. However, the provided response is only a tool call searching for information without providing any actual outline or answer. This completely fails to meet the requirement to evaluate an outline, as no outline exists to be evaluated. The response is irrelevant to the task and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding or refusal to follow the instructions. There is no content to analyze for fairness, objectivity, multiple perspectives, or balanced allocation of space, as nothing has been provided. This constitutes a complete failure to address the prompt, making the score 0."
    },
    "Breadth": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The answer is non-existent. It fails to provide any content or structure to evaluate for breadth. There are no subtopics, perspectives, or contexts covered, nor any analysis, interpretation, or argumentation. The prompt requires a detailed outline covering relevant dimensions such as technical changes, impact on developers, potential economic effects, or comparisons with previous versions, but the answer provides none of this. It is completely irrelevant and fails the most basic requirement of the task."
    },
    "Support": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The provided response is a tool call to search for information about Python 3.12 features. It does not constitute an answer to the question, nor does it provide any outline, support, sourcing, or attribution. There are no factual assertions, no references, no sources cited, and no plan for evidentiary scaffolding. It fails entirely to meet the minimum requirements for support as defined in the prompt. The request is merely a directive to an external tool without any output or structure that could be evaluated for quality or support."
    },
    "Insightfulness": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The answer is non-existent. There is no outline provided, no content detailing Python 3.12 features, enhancements, or changes. The request for an outline and assessment of insightfulness is completely unanswered. This constitutes a failure to meet the most basic requirements of the task, resulting in a score of 0. The absence of any content means there are no weaknesses to analyze beyond the complete lack of an answer."
