    "Instruction following": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The user provided a tool call to search for information about Python 3.12 features, but did not provide an actual answer or outline. The instruction was to create an answer, but the output is a tool call, which is irrelevant to the expected response format. This is a complete failure to follow the instruction to provide an answer. Missing required elements: answer content. Incorrect scope or level: output is a tool call, not an analysis or report. Deviation from requested format: no outline or structured report was generated. Factual inaccuracies: none applicable as no content was provided. Irrelevance: the tool call is not the expected answer format. Poor reasoning: no reasoning was attempted. Shallow content: not applicable. Stylistic issues: not applicable. The response fails to meet any expectation for the criterion of instruction following."
    },
    "Depth": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The evaluation is based solely on the prompt's instruction to search for features of Python 3.12. No actual outline or content was provided in the answer. Therefore, there is no substance to assess for depth, comprehensiveness, analytical subpoints, mechanisms, assumptions, methods, metrics, or logical sequencing. The answer fails entirely to meet the expectation of providing a structured, high-depth outline, as it does not exist. This results in a score of 0, reflecting a complete absence of the required quality criterion."
    },
    "Balance": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The prompt explicitly requires the evaluator to assess the quality of an answer to the question 'What are the key features of Python 3.12?' based on the criterion of 'Balance' in the outline. However, the provided response is only a tool call to 'search' for information about Python 3.12 features, and does not contain an actual outline or any content related to the question. This response fails to provide any structured report, analysis, interpretation, or argumentation, and therefore cannot be evaluated according to the specified criterion. It is irrelevant to the task and demonstrates a complete lack of engagement with the question. The absence of any content or outline means there are no elements to assess for balance, fairness, objectivity, or the inclusion of multiple perspectives. The response is non-functional and fails to meet the minimum requirements for any score other than 0."
    },
    "Breadth": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The prompt explicitly requires the evaluator to assess the 'Breadth' of an outline covering the key features of Python 3.12, considering dimensions like technical/operational, historical context, legal/regulatory, economic/market, ethical, social/cultural, geographic/comparative, stakeholder analysis, risks/limitations, and implementation pathways. However, the provided response is a placeholder indicating a tool call to 'search' for information, which is not an outline and does not contain any content to evaluate. Therefore, the response fails entirely to meet the criterion of Breadth as it provides no analysis, structure, or coverage of relevant subtopics or perspectives. The absence of any substantive content results in the lowest possible score."
    },
    "Support": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The provided response is empty and does not contain any content related to the question about Python 3.12 features. There are no factual assertions, no planned claims, no sources cited, no quantitative points specified, no qualitative points identified, and no evidence of any kind. The answer fails entirely to meet the minimum requirement of providing any support, let alone meeting the standards for higher scores. It is non-responsive and therefore scores 0."
    },
    "Insightfulness": {
      "rating": 0,
      "justification": "The answer is non-existent. There is no outline provided, no content detailing Python 3.12 features, and no analysis or structure. This fails completely to meet the criterion for Insightfulness, which requires a logically organized, insightful, and practically useful outline with concrete recommendations, real-world examples, and specific proposals for exhibits. The absence of any content results in a score of 0."
