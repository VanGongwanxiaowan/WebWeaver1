  "question": "What are the key features of Python 3.12?",
  "answer": "# Report\\n\\n## Introduction\\nPython 3.12 introduces significant enhancements across usability, performance, and developer experience. The release focuses on refining core language constructs and improving error handling to streamline development workflows. <citation>ev_0001(ev_0002)</citation>\\n\\n## Enhanced Error Messages\\nPython 3.12 delivers more informative error messages, particularly for module imports and class method references. The system now provides precise suggestions, reducing debugging time. <citation>ev_0001</citation>\\n\\n## More Expressive F-Strings\\nF-strings have been updated with Python's PEG parser, enabling string quotes inside expressions, backslashes, and newlines/comments. This flexibility allows for more readable and complex string formatting. <citation>ev_0001(ev_0002)</citation>\\n\\n## Refined Type Parameter Syntax\\nThe syntax for type parameters in generic classes and functions has been refined. Support for type aliases, TypeVarTuple, ParamSpec, and constrained type variables enhances type hinting expressiveness and conciseness. <citation>ev_0002</citation>\\n\\n## Performance Improvements\\nWhile specific performance metrics are not detailed in the summaries, the focus on type system improvements and error handling likely contributes to smoother execution and reduced runtime errors. <citation>ev_0002</citation>\\n\\n## Developer Experience Enhancements\\nThe combination of improved error messages and more expressive F-strings significantly boosts developer productivity by reducing friction in common tasks. <citation>ev_0001(ev_0002)</citation>\\n\\n## References\\n<references>\\n<reference>ev_0001</reference>\\n<reference>ev_0002</reference>\\n</references>",

    "Instruction following": {
      "rating": 9,
      "justification": "The outline follows the user's instructions well. It provides a clear hierarchical structure using Markdown headings (##) for main sections. The logical ordering is appropriate, starting with an introduction and then covering specific features (error messages, F-strings, type parameters, performance, developer experience). The scope is well-defined as listing key features of Python 3.12. The level of detail is sufficient, providing a brief description for each feature. The tone is informative and objective. Required sections like Introduction and References are included. The format is consistent with bullet points under each main feature heading. No prohibited items are included. Minor weakness: The claim about 'Performance Improvements' lacking detail is technically true for the provided text, but the structure still fulfills the requirement of covering this area. This does not significantly detract from the overall quality of instruction following."
    },
    "Depth": {
      "rating": 5,
      "justification": "The outline is structured logically with clear headings corresponding to key features of Python 3.12. However, it lacks analytical depth. Subpoints are minimal, primarily listing features without exploring mechanisms, causal drivers, assumptions, or uncertainties. There is no discussion of methods, metrics, or success criteria. The sequencing is logical but lacks explicit dependencies or build-up. Evidence is cited but not integrated into an analysis; examples and visuals are not mentioned. While not entirely shallow (it lists specific features), the lack of analytical scaffolding, detailed subpoints, and deeper exploration prevents it from reaching high depth. It meets basic organization but fails to provide the comprehensiveness and analytical rigor expected."
    },
    "Balance": {
      "rating": 5,
      "justification": "The outline is structured logically, covering several key features of Python 3.12. However, it exhibits significant weaknesses in balance and objectivity. The outline is heavily skewed towards presenting positive features (usability, performance, developer experience) without acknowledging or addressing any potential negative aspects, trade-offs, limitations, or alternative perspectives. There are no sections dedicated to counterarguments, controversial points, or the potential downsides of the introduced features. The headings and notes are neutral, but the overall content lacks any critical evaluation or mention of competing views, leading to an incomplete and unbalanced representation. This failure to include multiple perspectives or discuss limitations violates the core requirement of fairness and objectivity, resulting in a low score."
    },
    "Breadth": {
      "rating": 5,
      "justification": "The outline covers several distinct features of Python 3.12 (error messages, F-strings, type parameter syntax, performance, developer experience), demonstrating some breadth. However, it is highly focused solely on the technical features of the language itself. It completely lacks coverage of other relevant dimensions such as historical context, legal/regulatory, economic/market impact, technical/operational implications beyond syntax, ethical considerations, social/cultural impact, geographic/comparative aspects, stakeholder analysis (beyond developers), risks/limitations, or implementation pathways. The coverage, while technically relevant, is extremely narrow and fails to provide a holistic view, thus failing to meet the expectation of wide-ranging yet purposeful analysis across multiple contexts."
    },
    "Support": {
      "rating": 2,
      "justification": "The outline provides a basic structure covering key features of Python 3.12. However, the evidentiary scaffolding is severely deficient. It relies entirely on inline placeholders like <citation>ev_0001</citation> and a generic References section with <reference>ev_0001</reference> and <reference>ev_0002</reference>. These are non-existent, untraceable, and do not link to specific, verifiable sources (peer-reviewed articles, government databases, reputable news organizations) as required. There is no evidence provided for any factual assertion or planned claim within the outline. Vague references like 'studies show' are unacceptable, and the absence of any actual citations or URLs results in a score of zero. While the content outlines features accurately (as can be verified independently), the lack of any sourcing plan or attribution fails the core requirement for Support."
    },
    "Insightfulness": {
      "rating": 4,
      "justification": "The outline is logically structured, covering key features of Python 3.12. However, it is generic and lacks depth or originality. Each section primarily states a feature with minimal elaboration or insight. There is no analysis of non-obvious connections between features, nor is there a specific framing that makes the structure particularly efficient for surfacing insights. Recommendations are absent. Real-world examples, comparator cases, or specific proposals for exhibits (tables, charts) are missing. The mention of 'Performance Improvements' without specific metrics or analysis of *how* they contribute to insights is shallow. The content is factually aligned with the question but is purely descriptive and lacks actionable proposals or measurable outcomes, making it practically useful but not highly insightful."
