There’s something unnatural, even sinister about the relationship between Chloe (newcomer Kiera Allen) and her mom, Diane (Sarah Paulson). Diane has raised her daughter in total isolation, controlling every move she’s made since birth, and there are secrets that Chloe's only beginning to grasp. From the visionary writers, producers and director of the breakout film Searching, comes a suspense thriller that shows that when mom gets a little too close, you need to RUN.\n3222 comments\n", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Dhh7q9Us5c", "source": "tavily", "rank": 3}, {"title": "Run | Math Playground", "snippet": "Use your left and right arrow keys to control the runner.

Stop reading critical reviews, it’s a great game. There’s one other way to unlock some characters, that being by getting achievements in some of Kong’s other games, which is stupid. There’s an issue with the game crashing once you lose in infinite mode. Run 3 on steam would be the best experience if it could take the controls of the Cool Math Games version but take the updated version of the app. This game also features leaderboards and achievements. * ### Angry Gran Run - Running Game. * ### Run Race 3D — Fun Parkour Game.
