As a suicide risk, Chloe should have a 1:1 sitter at all times- a staff member, or at the least, a video monitor, to make sure she doesn't try to harm herself. The room should have been cleared of any sharp objects, as well as wires, ties, cords, hospital linens, etc, that could be used to make a noose. The nurse/doctor even acknowledges this risk by not allowing Chloe to use her pen, but commits a grave error leaving her alone in the room.
