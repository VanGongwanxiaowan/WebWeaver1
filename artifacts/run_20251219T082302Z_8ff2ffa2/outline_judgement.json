  "results": {
    "Instruction following": {
      "rating": 9,
      "justification": "The outline meticulously follows the user's instructions for a complex topic on multi-modal AIGC systems. It covers all required dimensions: construction methods, application scenarios, safety and ethical challenges, and future directions. The structure is logically organized with a clear hierarchical progression from introduction to conclusion, including standard sections like methodology, experiments, results, limitations, and references. Each section is appropriately detailed, reflecting a comprehensive scope. The tone is academic and analytical, suitable for the subject matter. Formatting is consistent, with clear section headings and a requested citation format. Minor weaknesses include the lack of specific details in some sections (e.g., methodology could benefit from more granular steps) and the absence of a dedicated 'Background' section, which could have provided context. However, these do not significantly detract from the overall quality and completeness of the outline, which adheres strongly to the user's requirements."
    },
    "Depth": {
      "rating": 9,
      "justification": "The outline demonstrates significant depth with specific subpoints, key arguments, mechanisms/causal drivers, and methods. It includes sequencing, dependencies, and integration points for evidence and visuals. However, it could be slightly improved by explicitly detailing assumptions and uncertainties more thoroughly in the Methodology and Future Work sections, and by providing more concrete examples of open questions in the latter. These minor omissions prevent a perfect score, but the overall structure and analytical scaffolding are robust and comprehensive."
    },
    "Balance": {
      "rating": 9,
      "justification": "The outline demonstrates strong balance by including multiple perspectives and counterarguments across key dimensions such as methodology, ethical challenges, limitations, and future work. It allocates space fairly to competing views, using neutral headings and notes. Sections explicitly address trade-offs (e.g., quality vs. safety vs. latency), limitations, and counter-evidence (e.g., data contamination risks). The language is generally neutral, and the structure comprehensively covers the question's multifaceted nature. Minor weaknesses include the lack of specific counterarguments in some sections (e.g., 'Related Work' could mention critiques of existing frameworks) and the absence of a dedicated section for alternative or competing AIGC approaches, but these do not significantly detract from the overall fairness and objectivity."
    },
    "Breadth": {
      "rating": 9,
      "justification": "The outline demonstrates excellent breadth by covering a comprehensive range of relevant subtopics including system construction (methodology), diverse application scenarios, in-depth analysis of safety and ethical challenges, and future development directions. It includes appropriate dimensions such as technical foundations, stakeholder considerations (through ethical and regulatory compliance), and implementation pathways. The inclusion of cross-modal alignment, copyright detection, and real-time processing techniques within the methodology section adds significant depth. While there are minor redundancies in some sections (e.g., related work and methodology), the overall structure is purposeful and avoids irrelevant tangents. The coverage is wide-ranging yet focused, meeting the high standards for breadth in addressing the complex question of multi-modal AIGC systems."
    },
    "Support": {
      "rating": 3,
      "justification": "The outline demonstrates a logical structure covering the required dimensions. However, it fails to meet the minimum requirement for providing verifiable source URLs. All citations are placeholders ('ev_0001', 'ev_0002') without actual author, outlet, date, or URL information. This lack of specific, traceable citations for factual assertions, planned quantitative points, qualitative examples, and ethical discussions prevents it from achieving even a basic level of evidentiary support as required by the criterion. While the content outlines what information should be included, it provides no actual evidence or sourcing plan. The absence of any references section or inline citations with real URLs results in a score of zero for sourcing, and thus a low overall score."
    },
    "Insightfulness": {
      "rating": 7,
      "justification": "The outline demonstrates a comprehensive structure covering construction, applications, challenges, and future directions of multi-modal AIGC systems. It includes relevant sections like Methodology, Experiments, and Future Work, which are crucial for a thorough analysis. The inclusion of specific technical details (e.g., CLIP, Vision Transformer, LoRA fine-tuning) and ethical considerations (bias detection, copyright protection) adds depth. However, the outline is somewhat generic in some sections, such as the Methodology and Experiments, lacking concrete, actionable recommendations or specific real-world examples. The comparative analysis with existing AIGC systems and the mention of specific datasets (COCO, ImageNet) are good, but the outline could be strengthened by including more detailed case studies or comparator cases. The limitations and future work sections are well-considered, but the overall lack of original structure or non-obvious connections prevents it from reaching excellence."
