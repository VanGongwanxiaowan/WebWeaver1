## Methodology
- System architecture: 
  - Asset management flow (ingestion, tagging, metadata extraction)
  - Content creation flow (prompting, generation, refinement)
  - Asset graph for relationships between multi-modal assets
  - Intelligent tags for categorization and retrieval
- Core modules:
  - Metadata extraction (using Vision Transformer for image/video features)
  - Copyright detection (blockchain digital fingerprinting, similarity search)
  - Content review (ethics filters, bias detection)
  - Text/image generation (GPT4, StableDiffusion with LoRA fine-tuning)
  - Video synthesis (diffusion models, temporal coherence)
- Technical foundations:
  - Cross-modal alignment (CLIP model for text-image, extensions for video/audio)
  - Generation control (LoRA fine-tuning for style, content constraints)
  - Asset analysis (Vision Transformer for feature representation)
  - Copyright protection (blockchain digital fingerprinting, watermarking)
- Three-step implementation approach:
  1) Multi-modal content generation system (integrating GPT4, StableDiffusion, video tools)
  2) Intelligent digital asset management system (SentenceTransformer, FAISS for cross-modal search)
  3) End-to-end workflow integration (APIs, pipelines)
- Key problem solutions:
  - Cross-modal contrastive learning for better alignment
  - LoRA fine-tuning control for ethical and quality constraints
  - Hierarchical indexing optimization for scalability
  - Real-time processing techniques for video synthesis
