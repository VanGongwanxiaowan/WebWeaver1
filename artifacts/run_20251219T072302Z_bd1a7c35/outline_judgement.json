    "Instruction following": {
      "rating": 9,
      "justification": "The outline follows the user's instructions well. It covers the topic (key features of Python 3.12) and scope adequately. The structure is logically organized with clear hierarchical levels (Introduction, Performance Improvements, New Syntax Features, Standard Library Updates, Security Enhancements, References). Each section addresses a specific dimension of Python 3.12 features. The level of detail is appropriate, providing a summary of each feature category. The tone is informative and objective. Required sections (Introduction, main feature categories, References) are present. The format uses clear headings. No prohibited items are included. Minor weakness: The content under each feature section is very brief and lacks specific examples or detailed explanations, which could be considered insufficient depth for 'key features'. However, the structure and coverage are largely excellent."
    },
    "Depth": {
      "rating": 5,
      "justification": "The outline is structured logically with clear sections for different features of Python 3.12. However, it lacks depth in several areas: 1) Specific subpoints within each section are generic (e.g., 'Performance Improvements' only mentions 'optimizations' without details on what they are). 2) There is no analysis of mechanisms/causal drivers for the features. 3) Assumptions and uncertainties are not addressed. 4) Methods, metrics, or success criteria for evaluating the features are missing. 5) The outline does not indicate sequencing or dependencies between features. 6) Evidence, examples, and visuals are referenced but not integrated into the outline structure itself. While comprehensive in listing topics, the lack of analytical scaffolding and specific details results in a shallow outline."
    },
    "Balance": {
      "rating": 6,
      "justification": "The outline is structured logically, covering key features of Python 3.12 (performance, syntax, standard library, security). However, it lacks balance by omitting sections for counterarguments, trade-offs, or limitations. The language in headings and notes is neutral, but the outline does not allocate space to competing views or discuss potential drawbacks or alternative approaches, nor does it explicitly mention limitations of the features described. This lack of critical perspective and consideration of alternative viewpoints results in a less fair and objective representation, warranting a score below the midpoint of the scale."
    },
    "Breadth": {
      "rating": 6,
      "justification": "The outline covers four distinct and relevant subtopics: Performance Improvements, New Syntax Features, Standard Library Updates, and Security Enhancements. This provides a decent breadth of coverage related to Python 3.12's key features. However, it is somewhat limited, missing other potentially important dimensions such as technical details of the performance optimizations, specific examples of new syntax features, impact on existing codebases, comparison with Python 3.11, or discussion on implementation challenges. The coverage is wide-ranging in the sense of covering major categories but lacks depth and specific examples within each category, making it purposeful but not fully comprehensive. It avoids tangents but does not explore each area thoroughly enough to be considered excellent."
    },
    "Support": {
      "rating": 2,
      "justification": "The outline provides a basic structure covering key features of Python 3.12. However, it completely fails to meet the minimum requirement for support by omitting any specific sources or citations for the claims made in each section. The placeholders '<citation>ev_XXXX</citation>' and corresponding '<reference>ev_XXXX</reference>' in the References section are not actual citations linking to verifiable sources (peer-reviewed articles, government databases, reputable news organizations) with traceable URLs or specific details like author/outlet, date, dataset/report, or case study. Vague statements like 'studies show' are unacceptable, and the absence of any actual sourcing renders the entire evidentiary scaffolding and sourcing plan non-existent. Factual accuracy cannot be assessed without sources, and the lack of specific quantitative or qualitative examples linked to sources further degrades the quality. This failure to provide even minimal, verifiable attribution for the factual assertions and planned claims results in a score of 2 out of 10."
    },
    "Insightfulness": {
      "rating": 4,
      "justification": "The outline is structurally sound and covers the expected dimensions (performance, syntax, standard library, security). However, it is generic and lacks depth or originality. Each section contains common knowledge about Python updates without highlighting non-obvious connections, specific real-world examples, or actionable recommendations. The content is shallow and unsupported by concrete details or evidence beyond citations. The structure is conventional, and there is no indication of a unique framing or sequencing designed to surface key insights efficiently. This results in a lack of practical usefulness or insightfulness beyond a basic overview."
